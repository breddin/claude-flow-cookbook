### **üìä Missing/Theoretical Components**

The document describes advanced concepts that are **partially implemented**:
- **Staged filtering pipeline**: Framework exists but needs specific time-series filters
- **Cost-based escalation**: ELO system provides foundation, needs cost integration  
- **Millisecond WASM nets**: WASM loader ready, needs ruv-fann neural models
- **On-device processing**: Architecture supports it, needs deployment configuration

The foundation is **revolutionary and comprehensive** - you have the infrastructure for exactly the staged intelligence system described in your neural-net.md document!
