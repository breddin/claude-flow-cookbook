From Reuven's LI Post:

AI pretty clearly has a capability to self improve. Anyone building agentic systems sees it daily. 

Recursion in training and use is the engine. One loop yields a tiny gain. Hundreds of loops compound into step‑changes.

My pattern is simple. 

Define a task, generate solutions in parallel, score them, then feed the winners back into the system. I mix three tracks: data, policy, and tools. 

Data track auto‑gens harder examples from failures. 

Policy track tunes behavior with lightweight updates. 

Tools track expands capabilities by calling code, search, or simulators.

My implementation looks like this. 

Evaluation uses a critic-fixer cycle with A/B testing, ELO ranking, and delta-based updates. A generic Verification Layer enforces a “truth is enforced, not assumed” principle. It validates every agent output with scoring, cross-agent checks, rollback triggers, and persistent verification memory. 

This layer is mode-tunable (strict, moderate, dev) and integrates with CI/CD for automated enforcement across the swarm.

For the intelligence substrate, I use ruv-fann and ruv-swarm. ruv-fann builds small, specialized Rust/WASM neural nets that update as lightweight deltas. ruv-swarm orchestrates them as an event-driven mesh, routing tasks to the right net and cascading outputs through others. 

Combined with enforced verification, these recursive micro-networks don’t just improve at tasks, they get better at getting better, safely and continuously.
